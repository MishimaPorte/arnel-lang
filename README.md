# ARNEL-LANG

### The Conception
The conception of this project lies within the heavenly bounds of a [qbe](https://c9x.me/compile/)-backed language that can compile to whatever target this great technology supports.
it is planned to add llvm backend in the future - when the language itself is finished.

The ultimate goal of the project is to learn how compiler backends work and to create something.
